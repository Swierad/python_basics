two applications built using Flask

1. lotto:
	the application simulates a lotto draw based on 6 numbers indicated by the user.
2. numbers game :
	the application draws a number from 1 to 100 and asks the user to guess the drawn number, after each of the guessing attempts, the application informs the user whether the indicated number was too 		small, too big or correct
3. Reverse guess number:
	just choose a number from 1 to 1000 and application will guess it in less then 10 tries, all You need to do is to give application information after each guess: "too small", "too much" or 		"correct".
